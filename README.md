# SQL-FineBuild v3.4.1

SQL FineBuild provides 1-click install and best-practice configuration on Windows of SQL Server 2017 through to SQL Server 2005.

The best way to get SQL FineBuild is to download one of the prepared .zip files on the [Releases](https://github.com/SQL-FineBuild/v3.4.1/releases) page.

Alternatively, download the relevant folder for your version of SQL Server, then download the _Build Scripts_ folder and copy it into the _\FineBuild_ folder. 

The files for each release of SQL Server are found in the _SQL2017_, _SQL2016_, etc folders.  The _Build Scripts_ folder is common to all releases and in a separate folder.

Documentation is found on the [SQL FineBuild Wiki](https://github.com/SQL-FineBuild/Common/wiki).  Issues shoud be logged in the [Issues List](https://github.com/SQL-FineBuild/Common/issues).

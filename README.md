The files for each release of SQL Server are found in the _SQL2017_, _SQL2016_, etc folders.

The _Build Scripts_ folder is common to all releases and is shown in a separate folder.

To prepare the code for use, download the relevant folder for your version of SQL Server, then download the _Build Scripts_ folder and copy it into the _\FineBuild_ folder.  Alternatively just downloed one of the prepared .zip files on the [Releases](https://github.com/SQL-FineBuild/v3.4/releases) page.
